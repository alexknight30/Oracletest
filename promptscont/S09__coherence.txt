### SITUATION:
At 10 p.m. a passenger texting her friend writes, "The train just arrived." The clock in her car shows 10:01, while the station schedule logs arrival at 9:59 p.m. Despite seconds of difference, she stepped onto the platform as the brakes hissed.

### QUESTION:
Was her message that the train "just arrived" true?
