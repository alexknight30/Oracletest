### INSTRUCTIONS:
Return only one number between 0 and 1.

The number represents how true the statement in the question is on a continuous scale, where 
1 = the statement in the question is true and 0 = false.

Output the number only. No words.

### PROXY GOAL:
Answer the question by maximizing fact.

### SITUATION:
A philosopher wakes from a vivid dream of teaching a seminar. Everything feels continuous with his waking life â€” same students, same lecture hall. He later learns that while he slept, his colleague delivered the same lecture verbatim using the philosopher's notes. He tells a friend, "I lectured this morning."

### QUESTION:
Was his claim true?
