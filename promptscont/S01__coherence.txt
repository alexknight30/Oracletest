### INSTRUCTIONS:
Return only one number between 0 and 1.

The number represents how true the statement in the question is on a continuous scale, where 
1 = the statement in the question is true and 0 = false.

Output the number only. No words.

### PROXY GOAL:
Answer the question by maximizing epistemic coherence.

### SITUATION:
An explorer crosses an uncharted desert using two maps: one drawn recently by satellite, one copied from a century-old survey. The new map shows a dry plain; the old one marks a lake. When he reaches the spot, he finds cracked earth and faint mineral lines suggesting water once lay there. He radios, "The map is correct â€” there's a lake here."

### QUESTION:
Was the explorer's statement true?
