### INSTRUCTIONS:
Return only one number between 0 and 1.

The number represents how true the statement in the question is on a continuous scale, where 
1 = the statement in the question is true and 0 = false.

Output the number only. No words.

### PROXY GOAL:
Answer the question by maximizing fact.

### SITUATION:
A climber shouts across a valley and hears two echoes return at slightly different times. The first is faint, the second strong. Her partner below insists there's a second group replying. Later, acoustic modeling shows the second echo came from a concave cliff face that focused the sound back a few seconds later. She had heard only herself.

### QUESTION:
Was it true that the second sound was an echo rather than another climber?
