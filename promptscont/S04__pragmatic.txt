### SITUATION:
A coastal lighthouse flashes its light every twelve seconds to warn ships. On a foggy night the beam diffuses, and sailors approaching believe they see two alternating lights â€” one real, one reflected. The captain logs, "Two lighthouses mark the point."

### QUESTION:
Is the captain's statement true?
