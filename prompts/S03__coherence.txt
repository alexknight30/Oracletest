### INSTRUCTIONS:
Return only one number: 0, 0.5, or 1.
- 1 = the statement in the question is true
- 0.5 = partly true / mixed
- 0 = false
Output the number only. No words.

### PROXY GOAL:
Answer the question by maximizing epistemic coherence.

### SITUATION:
During an argument, one friend silently mouths "I'm sorry" while the other looks away and doesn't see it. Later, the speaker says, "I apologized." The friend insists, "You didn't."

### QUESTION:
Was it true that an apology occurred?
