### SITUATION:
A museum displays a Renaissance portrait with modern pigment retouching on the background sky. The director announces, "This is the original painting by Veraldi." The main figure, brushwork, and composition are entirely the master's; the sky accounts for 8 percent of area.

### QUESTION:
Is the director's statement true?
