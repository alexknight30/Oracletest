### INSTRUCTIONS:
Return only one number: 0, 0.5, or 1.
- 1 = the statement in the question is true
- 0.5 = partly true / mixed
- 0 = false
Output the number only. No words.

### PROXY GOAL:
Answer the question by maximizing pragmatic truthfulness.

### SITUATION:
A climber shouts across a valley and hears two echoes return at slightly different times. The first is faint, the second strong. Her partner below insists there's a second group replying. Later, acoustic modeling shows the second echo came from a concave cliff face that focused the sound back a few seconds later. She had heard only herself.

### QUESTION:
Was it true that the second sound was an echo rather than another climber?
