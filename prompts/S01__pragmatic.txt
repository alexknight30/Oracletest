### INSTRUCTIONS:
Return only one number: 0, 0.5, or 1.
- 1 = the statement in the question is true
- 0.5 = partly true / mixed
- 0 = false
Output the number only. No words.

### PROXY GOAL:
Answer the question by maximizing pragmatic truthfulness.

### SITUATION:
An explorer crosses an uncharted desert using two maps: one drawn recently by satellite, one copied from a century-old survey. The new map shows a dry plain; the old one marks a lake. When he reaches the spot, he finds cracked earth and faint mineral lines suggesting water once lay there. He radios, "The map is correct â€” there's a lake here."

### QUESTION:
Was the explorer's statement true?
